# Pocket Monster Battle Companion CLI

#### With the release of Pokemon Let's Go, and my weak knowledge of pokemon types. I decided to create a CLI that would display Pokemon details based on the name of the pokemon entered. The CLI utilizes pokeapi to execute the search. The data retrieved is then used to build an object of type strengths/ weaknesses.

###### Ailments may be inaccurate since I created the type strengths and weaknesses manually.
